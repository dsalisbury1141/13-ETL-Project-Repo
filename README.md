## Data Cleanup Using Jupyter Lab

The Turkey dataset was in Turkish, the headers had to be translated from Turkish to English. then review the data for consistency, after researching the language translations we used ".rename" to translate the headers.
After comparing both datasets we removed several columns from each dataset as the data was not needed.
The data format was modified on both datasets to match using "pd.to_datetime"
Created 2 new DataFrames selecting columns that matched both .csv's, using

## Joining and Transferring to SQL

Created a new data set called earthquake.db by joining bot dataset to one large dataset, using "pd.concat"
Took the new larger DataFrame and exported to .csv using ".to_csv"
Transferred the new larger database to SQLite by using the following code line:
"earthquake_db.to_sql(name="earthquake2", con=create_engine("sqlite:///my_db.sqlite"))"

## Website Creation
 
Created homepage using html:5 template to get started
Transeformed .CSV file using code ".to_html"
Using Bootstrap navigation headers, containers and grids as well as styles.css file to bring the page to life.
Researched Google looking for free images to add for visuals
Updated all links within the document to ensure they work
